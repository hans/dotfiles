This a collection of dotfiles that fit my workflow. Tools that I use daily and that are customized / optimized by these files:

-  zsh
-  git
-  emacs
-  vim (more emacs-focused, though)
-  homebrew
-  PHP, Python, HTML, CSS, JS / CoffeeScript, Haskell, Lisp, Clojure

I've tried to make these configurations as portable as possible. Most of the customizations here have been tested to work on both Linux and OS X.

Sounds good? If you use similar tools—and spend a significant amount of time in your system's terminal—these dotfiles might just be a good fit for you.

## Sharing

Please fork this and make as many changes as you want, under one condition: tell me about it! I'd love any suggestions on customizations that you think would fit well in here.

My Emacs configuration (/emacs.d/) is based on Ryan McGeary's (a.k.a rmm5t) amazing collection of Emacs configs. You can find his dotfiles on [GitHub](https://github.com/rmm5t/dotfiles "rmm5t's dotfiles on GitHub").
